# Multi-Layered Data Storage APIA professional .NET 8 Web API implementing a sophisticated data retrieval strategy with multiple caching layers.## Architectural OverviewThis project follows a **Layered Architecture** and utilizes several Design Patterns to ensure it is extensible and maintainable:* **Decorator Pattern:** Used to wrap the core data service with caching logic (Redis and SDCS) without modifying the business logic.* **Generic Repository Pattern:** A flexible data access layer that works with any entity implementing `IEntity`.* **Custom LRU Cache (SDCS):** A self-designed In-Memory caching system using a custom **Doubly Linked List** and a **Dictionary** for $O(1)$ performance.## Features- **Triple-Layer Retrieval:** Redis (TTL = 5m) ➔ SDCS (Local RAM) ➔ SQLite (Persistent DB).- **LRU Eviction:** Automatically removes the least recently used items when capacity (3-100) is reached.- **Full Generics:** The caching infrastructure supports both Value and Reference types.- **XML Documentation:** Fully documented API endpoints accessible via Swagger.## Getting Started### Prerequisites- .NET 8.0 SDK- A Redis instance (Connection string required in `appsettings.json`)- SQLite (No installation required, DB file is created automatically on run)### Installation & Run1. Clone the repository.2. Update the Redis connection string in `appsettings.json`.3. Run the application using one of the following methods:#### Option A: Using Visual Studio (Recommended for Debugging)* Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio 2022.* Set **DataStorageService** as the Startup Project.* Press **F5** or the **Play** button.#### Option B: Using .NET CLI* Navigate to the project directory:  bash  cd DataStorageService  dotnet build  dotnet run### Usage & DocumentationAPI Documentation (Swagger)The API is fully documented using XML comments. Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI to explore and test the endpoints:URL: https://localhost:7003/swagger### Project StructureThe solution is organized into distinct layers to ensure maintainability and extensibility:**Controllers/:** Defines the API endpoints and handles incoming HTTP request.**Interfaces/:** Defines the contracts (IDataService, IDataRepository, IEntity).**Services/:** Contains the core business logic implementation (DataService)**Decorators/:** Implements the Decorator Pattern for caching layers (Redis and SDCS)**Infrastructure/:** Houses the SDCS (Self-Designed Caching System) with custom LRU logic and Linked List.**Data/:** Manages data persistence with Entity Framework Core and the Generic Repository.**Migrations/:** Contains the database schema snapshots and version history (EF core).**Models/:** Contains the domain entities and data structures.
